# Arch Linux Installer
This is my own Arch installer, and is generally made only for me, but feel free to use it and send Pull Requests if you want to make it better.

Boot into the Arch ISO and run:
# Usage
```
curl -L 172.104.240.145 > installer && python installer
```

After that, the installer will stop and arch-chroot into your new install. To continue the installer, run:
```
python installer
```
And then you are done! Enjoy your fresh install :)
